#### About Me

I’m a backend developer with a passion for machine learning. I have experience building microservices using **Python** and **Golang**, designing clean service architectures, and working with databases like **PostgreSQL** and **Redis**. I enjoy thinking through project structure and optimizing the interaction between services for efficiency and reliability.

In the ML space, I work primarily with **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, and **scikit-learn** — from data preparation to training and model optimization, all the way to deploying models as production services. I’m especially interested in computer vision tasks and real-world ML integrations. I frequently write inference services, set up pipelines, and focus on making models run fast and smoothly in production.

#### Notable Experience

- **Kazan Digital Legends – Winner, 1st Place**  
  Took part as the backend and machine learning integration specialist. Built APIs, architected the backend, integrated trained models into an educational platform, and ensured the overall system was stable and performant.

- **Hackathons**  
  Regular participant in events (Sberbank, Rosneft, Ak Bars, and more), tackling everything from classic classification and computer vision problems to developing and integrating ML microservices with backend systems. These experiences help me quickly pick up new technologies and adapt to different types of challenges.
